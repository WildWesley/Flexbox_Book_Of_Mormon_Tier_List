                <a class="Color-3" style="text-align: centerd;">The goal of my project was to gain a better understanding of the chronology of the Book of Mormon, but to do so in the most bodacious way possible. To accomplish this, I decided to make my own website with a most excellent cover image as I'm sure you've already noticed, and to categorize the Book of Mormon into a few major time periods with essential info about each: major events, major characters, righteousness tier list, etc.</a>
